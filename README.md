Homework 2 - Implement Date and Time Arithmetic

1-Add methods to both the Date and Time classes for adding and subtracting days, months, and years for Date and seconds, minutes, and hours for Time. Students should handle changes that cross month or year boundaries (e.g., adding 30 days to January 15) and day boundary for Time (e.g., adding 90 minutes to 23:30).

2-Implement a method in DateTime that computes the difference between two DateTime objects in terms of total days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

 

Extend the DateTime class to include a method

1- format(std::string formatString) where formatString specifies how the date and time should be displayed (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD", "HH:MM", "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS").

2-Allow the format string to include text, which must be echoed exactly, such as "Today is YYYY-MM-DD, and the time is HH:MM".
